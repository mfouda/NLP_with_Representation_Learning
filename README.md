## NLP with Representation Learning

Practice jupyter notebooks for RNN, encoder-decoder system, attention, LSTM staff implemented in pyTorch. 

### Get started
(for MacOS)

1. Download and install conda (Python3.6)
    - XCode is assumed
    - run `bash [installer_file_that_ends_with.sh]`
    - run `conda list` to confirm that installation succeeded
2. Setup conda environment and install jupyter notebook

    ```
    $ conda create -n learn_nlp python=3.6
    $ conda activate learn_nlp
    $ conda install jupyter notebook matplotlib scikit-learn
    $ conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab  # very helpful
    ```
    
3. Install pyTorch
   
   ```
   conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
   ```
